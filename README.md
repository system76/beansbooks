# Beans

## Getting Started

This guide will walk you through getting a local instance of Beans running. 
This is useful for development and testing, but should not be followed strictly 
for running a live environment.  In order to get started, you'll need the 
following:  

  *  Apache 2
  *  PHP 5.3+
  *  MySQL 5+
  *  Git Client

On Ubuntu, you can run the following to get up to speed:  

    sudo apt-get update  
    sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-cli php5-mysql php5-mcrypt php5-gd mysql-server mysql-client git  
  
Once you've installed all of the prerequesites, create a directory where you 
want the source to reside, then download the code from git into that directory. 
The following will create a directory called 'source' within your home directory 
and install beans there.

    cd ~
    mkdir source
    cd source
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/system76/beansbooks.git

You'll need to update the permissions on two directories before proceeding.
** TODO ** Talk about www-data

    chmod 770 -R application/logs
    chmod 770 -R application/cache

You should now have everything you need to run Beans locally.  Next, we'll 
configure the local instance of beans to work with the packages you setup 
above.  

## Configuring Packages

Before configuring Beans itself, we need to setup the environment to run 
it. We're going to quickly setup a local MySQL database, Apache Virtual Host, 
and create the correct permissions on our code.

### MySQL

When setting up the packages in "Getting Started" above, you should have been 
prompted to create a root password for MySQL.  You'll need this for the next 
set of steps.  Run the following to connect to MySQL - you should provide the 
password that you created earlier when prompted.

    mysql -h localhost -u root -p

Next - enter the following lines one by one.  Please note - this sets the 
password for your database user to "beansdb" and should probably be changed. 
Go ahead and replace "beansdb" with a strong password.

    CREATE USER 'beans'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY  'beansdb';  
    GRANT USAGE ON * . * TO  'beans'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY  'beansdb' WITH MAX_QUERIES_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_UPDATES_PER_HOUR 0 MAX_USER_CONNECTIONS 0 ;  
    CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS  `beans` CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `beans`.* TO 'beans'@'localhost';
    exit  

Great!  Now you've setup your database and user.  Please make a note of the 
username ( beans ) and password you set above.  

### Apache

First things first, enable Mod_Rewrite:

    sudo a2enmod rewrite

Now we're going to setup Apache to serve beans locally.  In order to determine 
where are going to set our document root, we need to run the following in a 
terminal:  

    pwd

Whatever the output of that is - make a note of it.  It will be the "document 
root" for your virtual host.
  
We're going to setup our instance of beans to be found at http://beans/ - 
this is convenient as it will neither interfere with an actual domain, and 
can be configured fairly easily.  Go ahead and run the following command:  

    sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/beans

That will open a text editor for a new virtual host configuration - go ahead and 
copy and paste the following into the file.  Make sure to replace PWDHERE with 
the result of running "pwd" above - it will probably looking something like 
/home/yourusername/source/beans and should be inserted without any trailing / .  

**TIP: To paste into the editor that you've opened, use Control + Shift + "v"**

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName beans 
        ServerAlias beans 

        DocumentRoot PWDHERE            
        <Directory PWDHERE>
                Options FollowSymLinks
                AllowOverride All
                Order allow,deny
                allow from all
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

After pasting in and editing the above code, hit Control + "x" to exit. If it prompts you 
to save your changes, hit "y".  Then run the following to enable the virtual host and 
reload the Apache configuration.  

    sudo a2ensite beans
    sudo service apache2 reload
  
Then we need to add an entry to your hosts file to be able to load the local 
instance of beans.  

	sudo sh -c "echo '127.0.0.1       test' >> /etc/hosts"
  
## Configure Beans  

**config.php**  

Copy example.config.php to config.php in application/classes/beans/ and fill in the appropriate information.

The last step is to run the configuration script.  Be sure to put your actual name and 
email address in, and generate a secure password to put in for your password.

    php index.php --uri=/install/manual --name="Your Name" --password="password" --email="you@email.address" --accounts="full"
